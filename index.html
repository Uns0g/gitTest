        <h1>What Is Git?</h1>
        <p>
            Git is a versioning system that saves the changes of a repository on a separated one through commits which
            work as snapshots of a piece of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want more info about git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F">see
                the official website</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Git?</h2>
        <p>
            Because every programmer use it, and you must use it too, is like a standar on code versioning and on coding
            as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            And also because <strong>Git is good</strong> and Mr. Torvalds is clever than your entire family tree.
        </p>
        <h1>How Does Git Work?</h1>
        <p>
            As far as I understood git works in a very peculiar way compared to other versioning system, instead of
            saving files to save the changes of a code and turning development a mess, git doesn't save the changes on
            files but in commits which are similar to screenshots you oftenly take on your PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Git creates a special repository called .git on the directory you selected to 'host' that repository. This
            repo saves the changes you make through commands you give in the Git BASH or via terminal.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting Git</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly you have to 'declare' to git who you are, for this you open the BASH and write the command
            <code>$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code>, after this write the other essencial command to
            git
            identify you <code>$ git config --global user.email yourEmail@example.com</code>. Git doesn't really
            "identifies" you, this is bullshit, but the greatest thing about learning and understanding git is cooperate
            with others and in order to do this you'll need to give these trivial personal info to github or you won't
            be able to use it properly and share your code with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter you can start the git really. Write <code>$ git init</code> to initialize the .git repo on your
            folder.
        </p>
        <h2>Some Famous Concepts Before Starting To Really Use it</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Commit</dt>
            <dd>A commit is like a save button, it "prints" the code that was added by <code>$ git add -A</code> on the
                branch you are currently working.</dd>
            <dt>Branch</dt>
            <dd>Branch is a sort of "photo gallery" of your code, is where your changes are saved on the repository. It
                is called "branch" because it really works like one. Imagine you want to change a piece of code but you
                need to keep the code the same. A paradox right? That is one of the situations you can create a new
                branch of the current branch you are working on. The branch will take everything from the branch that
                created it and you will be able to add code in this new branch without changing anything on the previous
                branch</dd>
            <dt>Repo</dt>
            <dd>Kind of obvious but a repo is an abbreviation for repository and a repository is a place where you store
                things, in this case files and folders.</dd>
            <dt>Gitignore</dt>
            <dd>This is a file you can create on your <strong>master</strong> branch that will ignore untracked files you indicate there. See <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore/#_pattern_format">the docs about gitignore</a>.</dd>
            <dt>Push</dt>
            <dd>Push is actually a git command (<code>$ git push</code>) which enables you to... push a local repository
                (one in your PC) to a remote one on GitHub.</dd>
            <dt>Pull</dt>
            <dd>"The oposite", you may have thought, and you are right, when you pull a repository it means that you are
                bringing what is into it to your local repository. Is also a git command (<code>$ git pull</code>).</dd>
        </dl>
        <h1>Really Using it</h1>
        <p>
            Now to really use it you should open your repository create a file (if you didn't do it yet) and write
            something, to identify what you did as a change you must write <code>$ git add -A</code> in BASH and to "send
            it" to the branch you are (by) you must write
            <code>$ git commit -m "<i>some message explaining what you did</i>"</code>, so simple as that.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a new branch write: <code>$ git branch <i>branchName</i></code>. To see it write:
            <code>$ git branch</code> and the branch you are currently in will apear brither and with a <strong>*</strong>
            before it. To move right to the branch you created write: <code>$ git checkout branchYouWant</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Main Commands On Local Repositories</h2>
        <p>
            The git main commands <strong>after you started a git repo</strong> are the following:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <th>Command</th>
