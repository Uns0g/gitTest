# Learning Git
The project is the way I found to share my few knowledge on git with others at the same time I learn how Github works and create this first repo on my profile.  
I shall keep it as a single page, if you want to use it to build any other site fell free to do it but I what I want for this small project is to keep it small. 

> The original name for this 'project' of mine were "Learning Git" but i had to remove it and create a new remote here on github with a new name, so it continues to be "Learning Git"
